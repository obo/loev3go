TODO

These are some things I'd like to add, sometime:

* Self-recursive functions should use tail call elimination (i.e., you
  shouldn't get a stack overflow).  Other recursion doesn't need this
  optimization (it messes up tracebacks and other debugging).

* The way errors are handled is kind of dumb.  I think it can be done
  much more intelligently, maybe using ``paste.excections`` or
  something similar.

* Keyword arguments for function calls aren't supported.  This makes
  it hard to use lots of Python code where keywords are used heavily.
