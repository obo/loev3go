Introduction
------------

PyLogo is a Logo interpreter written in Python. Its implementation is
small, and is based on the language as implemented by UCBLogo. The
Logo language is a learning language, intended for children for which
more "complete" languages aren't appropriate. Many of Logos language
design choices are driven by this, and differ from Python.

For more, read the documentation:

* `Main docs <PyLogo.html>`_

* `Description of the Logo Language <LogoLanguage.html>`_

* `Internal API <api.html>`_ (for people integrating PyLogo into
  Python environments)

* `To-Do <TODO.html>`_
