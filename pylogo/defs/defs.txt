Logo Definitions
================

Files in this directory are annotations of Python modules.  Each file
named XXX.logodef is an annotation of the XXX module.

Blank lines and lines starting with ``;`` or ``#`` are ignored as
comments.

Other lines should start with the name of the function that is being
annotated, then a ``:``.  Options, separated by spaces, follow on the
line.

An ``*`` means that the original (Python) name of the function should
not be used when importing the function.  A word ``arity:N`` will set
the default arity of the function to N.  Any other words will be
interpreted as aliases for the function.
